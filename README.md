# Dna-Sequencing-and-Matching
To create a genetic matching and detection of exact matches  between two given DNA samples and finding an approximate match  for a given DNA sample. 
# Overview:
This project is a genetic analysis application that performs exact and approximate DNA sequence matching, mutation detection, and builds phylogenetic trees to show evolutionary relationships.

Technologies and Algorithms Used:

Smith-Waterman Algorithm (for local alignment)

Boyer-Moore Algorithm (for approximate pattern matching)

Hamming Distance (for mutation detection)

UPGMA (for phylogenetic tree construction)

Tkinter GUI

NetworkX and matplotlib for graph visualization

# Key Features:

Matches two DNA sequences for exact and approximate results

Detects point mutations, useful in early cancer detection

Creates evolutionary trees based on genetic distances

Visualizes sequences as weighted graphs

GUI for ease of interaction

# Conclusion:
A complete bioinformatics toolkit that can assist researchers in genetic analysis, mutation identification, and species comparison using graphical and algorithmic methods.
